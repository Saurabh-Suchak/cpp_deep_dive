# <u>**Introduction to Object Oriented Programming**</u>


## **<u>Principles of Object Oriented Programming</u>**

1. <u>**Abstraction**</u> : Object Oriented approach gives a systematic method to develop software, apps and solutions in an organised way just how other engineers develop buildings, blue prints or any other things in a systematic manner.This allows the user to not know how the entire program works, just giving user enough idea about how to perform functions he/she wants to perform. Just like a TV or Car, internal mechanism is not available what user can interact with is more than enough to accomplish all the tasks users might need to perform. We write stuff inside class

2. **<u>Encapsulation :</u>**  Another thing we get due to class is encapsulation or data hiding.To avoid mishandling of variables we use data encapsulation. Functions used to access variables and modify them are public, but direct modification of variables is avoided by making variables inside a class as private.
3. **<u>Inheritance :</u>** Say we have written a class A, and after some days we want another class B which has all the features as class A along with some other features too which I will add. Then we can borrow/inherit all the features of A, add our own features to get class B.
4. **<u>Polymorphism :</u>**   C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.
