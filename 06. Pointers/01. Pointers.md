# Pointers 

Pointers are a type of variable in C++. These are also there in C. Pointer is a variable which is used to store the address of the data. Based on this variables can be categorized into 2 kinds :

1. Data Variables (Used to store data)
2. Address Variables (Used for storing address)

int *ptr ; // Declaration of a pointer.
ptr = &x ; // Initialization of a pointer.
cout << x ; // Gives output as 10.
cout << &x ; // Gives 200, address of x.
cout << ptr ; // 200, address of x as we did ptr = &x above
cout << &ptr ; // Gives 300, address in memory for ptr.
cout << *ptr; // Displays the data stored at the memory address which ptr holds i.e. 10 Dereferencing


# Why Pointer s ?

Our program i.e. stuff inside main is in code section and it can either access the same code section or the stack above it but it cannot access heap directly. Program has a policy of not accessing anything else directly in the system except stack and code section. So, a program can't directly access heap, but indirectly program can access heap, by declaring a pointer which is in stack and that pointer can have address of a memory in heap . So pointer will help the main function or program to access the heap area. Program can access heap only through the use of pointers.
