**Data Types can be categorized into 3 types :**

1. Built-in Data Types (Primitives)
2. Derived Data Types
3. User-defined Data Types


|   DATA TYPE   |      MEANING      |    SIZE   (depends on machine)  |
| :-----------: | :---------------: | :---------: |
|     bool      |      boolean      |  undefined  |
|     char      |     character     |   8-bits    |
|    wchar_t    |     wide char     |   16-bits   |
|   char16_t    |   unicode char    |   16-bits   |
|   char32_t    |   unicode char    |   32-bits   |
|     short     |   short integer   |   16-bits   |
|      int      |      integer      |   16-bits   |
|     long      |   long-integer    |   32-bits   |
|   long long   | very-long integer |   64-bits   |
| unsigned char | single-precision  |   32-bits   |
|     float     | double-precision  |   64-bits   |
|    double     | double-precision  | 10/16 bytes |

If machine is 16-bits then the integer by default takes 2 bytes (1 Byte = 8 bits), if machine is 64 bits then integer takes 8 bytes and so on.

It is only applicable for integers, float always takes 4 bytes and char always takes 1 byte only, it is only the size of integer that depeneds on the bit-size of the machine.

Sign bit is used to store the negative number. Say we want to store 10. Then 4 bits from right in order of writing from left to right would be 1010 in 16 bits it changes to 0000000000001010 for negative 10 first the binary form is complemented that is inversion of 0's and 1's with respect to positive version of the number so we get 1111111111110101 and this is called 1's complement. Then 1 is added at the rightmost bit giving us 1111111111110110 and this is called 2's complement of number. In any language the negative number is stored in the 2's complement form. Binary number is complemented called 1's complement and then added +1 to get 2's complement to get negative of original number we complemented, leading to MSB or leading bit becoming 1 for negative.
